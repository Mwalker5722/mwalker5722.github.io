                <h2>Terms of Service for the All-in-One Realtor System</h2>
                <p><em>Effective Date: August 21, 2025</em></p>
                <p>These Terms of Service ("Terms") govern your use of the All-in-One Realtor System (the "Service") provided by The Index Cloud ("we," "us," or "our"). By submitting your information and agreeing to use the Service, you agree to be bound by these Terms.</p>
                
                <h3>1. Description of the Service</h3>
                <p>The Service is an automated lead generation and qualification system for real estate professionals ("Client" or "you"). It includes: (a) management of digital advertising campaigns to generate leads; (b) an automated AI assistant that makes outbound calls to qualify leads; and (c) a system to facilitate the booking of appointments with qualified leads.</p>

                <h3>2. Client Responsibilities</h3>
                <p>To ensure the success of the Service, you agree to:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Provide accurate and complete information for the setup of your campaigns.</li>
                    <li>Ensure timely and consistent access to your calendar to allow for automated appointment booking.</li>
                    <li>Make a reasonable effort to be available for appointments booked by the Service. **The 5-Booking Money-Back Guarantee may be voided if the Client repeatedly misses or is unavailable for scheduled appointments.**</li>
                    <li>Follow up with all booked appointments in a timely and professional manner.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. The 5-Booking Money-Back Guarantee</h3>
                <p>We guarantee that the Service will book a minimum of five (5) qualified phone appointments on your calendar within the first ninety (90) days of service. A "qualified appointment" is defined as a lead who has been vetted by the AI and has agreed to an initial phone call. **If this guarantee is not met, you will receive a full refund of your service fee.** This guarantee does not promise closed deals or a specific financial return.</p>

                <h3>4. Payment Terms</h3>
                <p>The fees for the Service will be detailed in your specific service agreement. Payments are due on a recurring monthly or quarterly basis. Failure to make timely payments may result in the suspension or termination of your Service. All fees are non-refundable, except as explicitly stated in the 5-Booking Money-Back Guarantee.</p>

                <h3>5. Term and Termination</h3>
                <p>The initial term of this agreement is ninety (90) days to align with the Guarantee. After the initial term, the Service will continue on a month-to-month basis unless a new term is agreed upon. You may cancel the service at any time by providing 30 days' written notice. We reserve the right to terminate the service for any reason, including non-payment or violation of these terms.</p>

                <h3>6. Intellectual Property</h3>
                <p>We retain all rights, title, and interest in and to the All-in-One Realtor System, our AI assistants, and all related technology and materials. Your use of the Service does not grant you any ownership rights.</p>

                <h3>7. Disclaimers and Limitation of Liability</h3>
                <p>The Service is provided "as is." We do not warrant that the Service will be error-free or that it will result in a specific number of closed transactions. Our liability is limited to the terms of the 5-Booking Money-Back Guarantee.</p>

                <h3>8. Data Privacy</h3>
                <p>Your submission of personal information, and the information of leads generated for you, is governed by our <a href="#" onclick="showPrivacyFromLink(event)">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>

                <h3>9. Governing Law</h3>
                <p>These Terms shall be governed by the laws of the State of South Carolina.</p>

                <h3>10. Contact Us</h3>
